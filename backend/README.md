## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content (adjust as needed):

```
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://qr_user:qr_password@localhost:5433/qr_checkin_db"

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET="your-development-jwt-secret-key-change-this-in-production"
JWT_EXPIRATION="1d"

# Redis Configuration (optional for development)
REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6380"

# Application Configuration
PORT=4000
NODE_ENV=development
FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:3000"
ADMIN_URL="http://localhost:3001"

# Debug (optional)
DEBUG=prisma:*,app:*
```

### 3. Start Database Services

Start PostgreSQL and Redis using Docker Compose:

```bash
cd ..
docker-compose up -d postgres redis
```

### 4. Database Setup

Generate the Prisma client and run migrations:

```bash
npm run prisma:generate
npm run prisma:migrate
```

### 5. Seed the Database (Optional)

Populate the database with initial data:

```bash
npm run prisma:seed
```

### 6. Start the Server

For development with auto-reload:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

For production:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start:prod
```

## API Documentation

### GraphQL Playground
Once the server is running, access the GraphQL playground at:
**http://localhost:4000/graphql**

### B2B API Examples

#### Authentication
```graphql
# Login with organization context
mutation Login($email: String!, $password: String!) {
  login(email: $email, password: $password) {
    token
    refreshToken
    user {
      id
      email
      role

          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Multi-tenant Operations
```graphql
# Get organization events
query GetOrganizationEvents($organizationId: ID!) {
  organization(id: $organizationId) {
    name
    venues {
      id
      name
      events {
        id
        name
        startTime
        attendeeCount
        capacity
      }
    }
  }
}

  createVenue(input: $input) {
    id
    name
    organization {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
