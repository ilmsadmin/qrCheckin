## Integration with Production Backend

The Android app is designed to integrate seamlessly with the **production-ready B2B SaaS backend**:

### GraphQL Integration
```kotlin
// Example: Organization-scoped event query
query GetOrganizationEvents($organizationId: ID!, $venueId: ID) {
  organization(id: $organizationId) {
    events(venueId: $venueId) {
      id
      name
      startTime
      endTime
      venue {
        name
        location
      }
      attendeeCount
      capacity
    }
  }
}

// Example: Role-based mutation
mutation CreateEvent($input: CreateEventInput!) @authenticated(role: [VENUE_MANAGER, ORG_ADMIN]) {
  createEvent(input: $input) {
    id
    name
    venue {
      organization {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Authentication Flow
```kotlin
// JWT handling with organization context
data class AuthToken(
  val accessToken: String,
  val refreshToken: String,
  val user: User,
  val organizations: List<UserOrganization>,
  val permissions: List<Permission>
)

// Organization selection after login
sealed class AuthState {
  object Unauthenticated : AuthState()
  data class SelectingOrganization(val user: User, val organizations: List<Organization>) : AuthState()
  data class Authenticated(val token: AuthToken, val currentOrganization: Organization) : AuthState()
}
```

### Multi-tenant Data Handling
```kotlin
// Repository with organization context
class EventRepository @Inject constructor(
  private val api: GraphQLApi,
  private val authManager: AuthManager
) {
  suspend fun getEvents(venueId: String? = null): List<Event> {
    val organizationId = authManager.currentOrganization.id
    return api.getOrganizationEvents(organizationId, venueId)
  }
}
```
