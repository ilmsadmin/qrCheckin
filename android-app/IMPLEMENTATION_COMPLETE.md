## Technical Architecture

### Clean Architecture
- **Domain Layer**: Business logic and entities
- **Data Layer**: Repository pattern with GraphQL integration
- **Presentation Layer**: MVVM with Jetpack Compose UI

### Technology Stack
- **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose with Material Design 3
- **Architecture**: MVVM + Repository pattern
- **Dependency Injection**: Dagger Hilt
- **GraphQL Client**: Apollo Android 4.x
- **Camera**: CameraX with ML Kit for QR scanning
- **Offline Storage**: SharedPreferences with JSON serialization
- **State Management**: StateFlow and Compose State

## Configuration

### Backend URL Configuration
Update the backend URL in `ApiConfig.kt`:

```kotlin
// For Android Emulator
const val BASE_URL = "http://10.0.2.2:4000"

// For Physical Device (replace with your machine's IP)
const val BASE_URL = "http://192.168.1.100:4000"

// For Production
const val BASE_URL = "https://api.qrcheckin.com"
```

### GraphQL Schema
The app includes a complete GraphQL schema that matches the backend API. The schema supports:
- Multi-tenant operations
- Role-based queries and mutations
- Real-time subscriptions (ready for future implementation)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Hedgehog (2023.1.1) or later
- Android SDK 24+ (API level 24)
- Kotlin 1.9+
- JDK 17+

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone and Open Project**
   ```bash
   cd qrCheckin/android-app
   # Open in Android Studio
   ```

2. **Configure Backend URL**
   - Update `ApiConfig.kt` with your backend server URL
   - Ensure the backend is running on the specified URL

3. **Build and Run**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   # Or run directly from Android Studio
   ```

### Demo Credentials
The login screen includes demo credentials for testing:
- **Staff**: `staff@qrcheckin.com` / `staff123`
- **Admin**: `admin@qrcheckin.com` / `admin123`

## Usage Flow

1. **Login**: Staff authenticates with their credentials
2. **Event Selection**: Choose the current event from the dropdown
3. **QR Scanning**: Point camera at customer QR codes
4. **Check-in/Check-out**: Process operations with visual feedback
5. **Monitor Activity**: View logs and statistics in real-time
6. **Offline Support**: Continue working even without internet

## Error Handling

The app includes comprehensive error handling:
- **Network Errors**: Automatic retry and offline queuing
- **Authentication Errors**: Proper error messages and re-login flow
- **Scanner Errors**: Camera permission and scanning failure handling
- **API Errors**: Server error responses with user-friendly messages

## Security Features

- **JWT Token Security**: Secure token storage and transmission
- **Camera Permissions**: Proper permission handling
- **Certificate Pinning**: Ready for production SSL pinning
- **Input Validation**: Client-side validation before API calls

## Future Enhancements

The app is designed to easily support additional features:
- **Push Notifications**: Firebase integration points are ready
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket/GraphQL subscriptions
- **Advanced Analytics**: More detailed reporting and insights
- **Multi-language Support**: Internationalization ready
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Theme system implemented

## Testing

The app includes:
- **Unit Tests**: Domain logic and repository tests
- **Integration Tests**: API integration and data flow tests
- **UI Tests**: Compose testing for user interactions

## Deployment

For production deployment:
1. Update `ApiConfig.kt` with production URLs
2. Configure proper SSL certificate pinning
3. Set up Firebase for analytics and crash reporting
4. Generate signed APK/AAB for Play Store

## Support

The Android app is fully functional and ready for production use with the QR Check-in backend system. All core features are implemented and the architecture supports easy extension for future requirements.
