# Apollo Client Authentication & Error Handling Improvements

This document summarizes the changes made to improve Apollo Client connections and authentication in the QR Check-in application.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Apollo Client Configuration
- Simplified the Apollo Client configuration to use Next.js API routes
- Removed redundant API proxy and standardized on Next.js rewrites
- Enhanced error handling for both GraphQL and network errors
- Added detailed logging for easier debugging

### 2. Authentication Flow
- Improved login process with better error handling
- Added retry logic for network errors during authentication
- Enhanced error messages to be more user-friendly
- Created a reusable API connection status component

### 3. User Experience
- Added visual indicators for connection status
- Improved error message display with actionable suggestions
- Created a help page with demo accounts and troubleshooting tips
- Added support for prefilling login credentials from the help page

### 4. Testing & Debugging
- Added a test script (`npm run test:api`) to verify API connections
- Enhanced logging throughout the authentication process
- Added more detailed error information in the developer console

## Files Modified
- `/src/lib/apollo.ts` - Apollo Client configuration
- `/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Authentication context provider
- `/src/pages/login.tsx` - Login page UI and error handling
- `/src/pages/help.tsx` - Help page with demo accounts
- `/next.config.js` - API rewrites configuration
- `/src/components/ApiConnectionStatus.tsx` - New reusable component

## Common Issues & Solutions

### CORS Issues
The application now uses Next.js API routes to proxy requests to the backend, which helps avoid CORS issues that may occur when connecting directly to the backend.

### Network Connectivity
The application now provides better feedback about network connectivity issues and will automatically retry operations when the connection is restored.

### Authentication Errors
Enhanced error handling provides more specific information about authentication failures, including invalid credentials, expired tokens, and server errors.

### Testing
Use the `npm run test:api` command to verify API connectivity and test login credentials.
