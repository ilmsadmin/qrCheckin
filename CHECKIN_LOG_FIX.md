# GraphQL CheckinLog Issue Fix

## Problem Statement
The admin/logs frontend was throwing a 400 error due to a field mismatch between the frontend GraphQL query and the backend resolver.

## Root Cause
1. **Frontend Query**: `GET_ALL_CHECKIN_LOGS` expected:
   - `checkinLogs(limit: $limit, offset: $offset)` with `action` field
   
2. **Backend Resolver**: Provided:
   - `checkinLogs(userId?: string, eventId?: string)` with `type` field
   - Returned stringified JSON instead of proper GraphQL types

## Solution
1. **Created CheckinLog GraphQL ObjectType** (`backend/src/common/dto/checkin-log.dto.ts`):
   - Proper GraphQL schema definition
   - Added `action` field as getter that maps to `type` field for frontend compatibility
   - Included all required fields: id, userId, eventId, type, timestamp, location, notes, user, event

2. **Updated CheckinResolver** (`backend/src/checkin/checkin.resolver.ts`):
   - Added support for `limit` and `offset` parameters
   - Changed return type from `String` to proper `CheckinLog[]` type
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing `userId` and `eventId` parameters

3. **Updated CheckinService** (`backend/src/checkin/checkin.service.ts`):
   - Modified `getCheckinLogs` method to accept `limit` and `offset` parameters
   - Added pagination support with Prisma's `take` and `skip`

4. **Fixed Build Issues**:
   - Removed unused Prisma type imports from mappers that were causing build failures
   - Maintained functionality while working with any types

## Field Mapping
- Database: `checkin_logs.type` (CHECKIN/CHECKOUT enum)
- Backend DTO: Both `type` and `action` fields (action = type getter)
- Frontend GraphQL: `action` field

## Testing
- Created unit test for CheckinLog DTO to validate field mapping
- Verified both frontend and backend build successfully
- Confirmed existing functionality is preserved

## GraphQL Schema Changes
```graphql
type CheckinLog {
  id: ID!
  userId: ID!
  eventId: ID!
  type: CheckinType!
  action: String!  # Maps to type field
  timestamp: DateTime!
  location: String
  notes: String
  user: User!
  event: Event!
}

type Query {
  checkinLogs(
    limit: Int
    offset: Int
    userId: String
    eventId: String
  ): [CheckinLog!]!
}
```

This fix ensures that the frontend admin/logs page will now receive the expected data structure and should resolve the 400 error.
